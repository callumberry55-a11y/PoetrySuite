## 1. Core Software & Structural Architecture

This 2GB Poetry Suite, including the 30+ relational database tables, the 972.89 KiB service worker, and all symmetrical UI frameworks, is protected by UK Copyright Law (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988). Unauthorized reproduction, decompilation, or "shattering" of the codebase is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Autonomous Agents & AI-Generated Work

The AI Security Guard and Neural Cartographer are proprietary autonomous agents. Under Section 9(3) of the UK CDPA 1988, the legal author of any computer-generated content is the person who undertook the "arrangements necessary" for its creation. As such, all technical remediations, thematic maps, and creative outputs generated by these agents are the sole property of the developer.

## 3. Trade Secrets & Neural Logic

The £0.75-per-point valuation, the "Neural Handshake" protocols, and the Manual Override Chat Service are treated as Trade Secrets.

- These elements derive specific economic value from remaining non-public.
- Access to the underlying logic or API keys is granted strictly under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
- Any attempt to reverse-engineer the autonomous decision-making logic will be treated as a breach of trade secrecy.

## 4. Licensing & PaaS Access

Commercial rights and PaaS (Poetry-as-a-Service) integration keys for Version 123.1.1-Beta.2 and beyond are subject to a separate licensing agreement.
